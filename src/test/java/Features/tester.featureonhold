Feature: About Testers

In order to get a high paid job
As a Tester
I want to learn automation

Given I am a "manual" tester
When I apply for a job
Then I got "less" paid job
And I am "not" satisfied with my salary
But my parents are "still" satisfied

Scenario: I am a automation tester
Given I am a "automation" tester
When I apply for a job
Then I got "high" paid job
And I am "very" satisfied with my salary
But my parents are "highly" satisfied
